# STM32M0

Drivers and source code of various STM32M0 projects

## About the code

Most of these source code files will be proof of concept, but indeally, a lot cleaner than most arduino, nucleo etc. projects
I've seen. The general idea is to get the code working, with the code being cleaned 
up over time. Most code is designed around the philosophy of "make it fast, readable, and lightweight." The KISS principle
is applied when possible.

## Acknowledgments

All the websites, documents, and sample codes I've used to help me make these projects possible.
